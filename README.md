# 👋 Hey there! I'm Luis Angel Camarena Martínez

**Intelligent Systems Engineering student** at UASLP 🎓  
Passionate about building software that *actually* solves problems — especially in digital communities, indie games, and systems with solid architecture (and a little flair, of course).

---

## 🚀 What I'm working on:

- 🕹️ **PlayNetix** – A gamer platform with marketplace, forums, achievements, user profiles, and game rating systems.  
- ⛪ **Parish Management System** – Handling users and processes for a local church community.  
- 🌐 **Web development with MEAN** – Angular, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

---

## 🧠 What drives me:

- Automating the boring stuff (because time = coffee).
- Designing interfaces that don't make you want to rage-quit.
- Staying curious and always learning (even when the bugs try to test my patience).

---

## 🛠️ Tech I enjoy using:

- **Frontend**: Angular, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Laravel, Express  
- **Mobile**: Flutter  
- **Databases**: MongoDB, MySQL  
- **Other**: Firebase, Git, Docker (when it's behaving)
